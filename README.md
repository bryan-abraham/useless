# USEFUL.ai üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Algo Avengers


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Bryan Abraham- TIST
- Member 2: Akhil PS - TIST

### Project Description
AI Answer Generator is a hilarious web application that takes your questions and responds with either completely unrelated advice or savage roasts! It's the perfect tool for when you need a laugh or want to be reminded that your questions might not be as brilliant as you think they are.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are getting way too many relevant and serious answers to their questions these days. The world is suffering from an epidemic of useful responses! Where's the fun in that?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter the AI Answer Generator - a revolutionary tool that ensures you never get a straightforward answer to your questions again! It either provides completely unrelated advice or roasts you for asking in the first place. It's like having a sarcastic friend who never actually helps but always keeps you entertained!
